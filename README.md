A Python wrapper for the DM API. The majority of functions have samples written in Visual Basic or C# contained in DM Samples/. The tricky part of working with the DM API is our installation of DM is slightly different than what is contained in the samples, meaning the required fields for profiles are different for our installation, and certain objects within DM are named differently. See the WorkedExamples notebook, along with DM.py for more examples. Also the following email exchanges may prove useful:
